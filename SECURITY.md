# Security

Sontag is basically a JavaScript runtime, primarily meant to be used in static site generators with your own templates and your own content. __Do not use Sontag with untrusted templates and do not populate your templates with untrusted content__, which is akin to running untrusted scripts on the machine or in the browser.

## Threat model

TODO: add examples of the dangers of untrusted templates and/or untrusted content in Node.js, browser environments.
